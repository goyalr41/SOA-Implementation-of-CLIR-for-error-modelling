QUALITIES OF A GOOD INSTRUCTOR 2'!

6. Control your temper at all times.

An instructor who “blows oﬁ” is likely to say
things he doesn’t mean, and usually regrets his hasty
action later. Self-control is essential in maintaining
proper control of a class.

7. Be a good sport.

The student who put a tack on the instructofs
chair was immediately sent to the ‘principal by a
man who did not “appreciate the point.” Students
Will test an instructor’s sportsmanship. They like a
good sport who can take a joke and accept it in the
spirit in which it is made.

8. Be patient when students ask questions, or can't do
the work.

Patience is a virtue -—-— particularly when questions
are asked which appear unnecessary or stupid. All
students cannot be expected to develop skill Os
knowledge as quickly as the instructor desires. Pa»
tience and understanding are qualities that every
good instructor must possess in order to do an effec-
tive teaching job.

9. Maintain sufficient reserve.

A good instructor is not “one of the boys.” He
must command the respect of his students and can-
not let down the bars too far. Students look up to
the man who maintains the reserve required of his
position, particularly during school hours.
